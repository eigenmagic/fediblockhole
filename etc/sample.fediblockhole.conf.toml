# If `count` type is selected, the threshold is reached when the domain
# is mentioned in at least `merge_threshold` blocklists. The default value
# of 0 means that every block in every list will be merged in.
# If `pct` type is selected, `merge_threshold` is interpreted as a percentage,
# i.e. if `merge_threshold` = 20, blocks will only be merged in if the domain
# is present in at least 20% of blocklists.
# Percentage calculated as number_of_mentions / total_number_of_blocklists.
# The percentage method is more flexibile, but also more complicated, so take care
# when using it.
